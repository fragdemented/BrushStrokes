# BrushStrokes
 This program takes samples from an image, and recreates it to make a new image that looks like an oil painting. Written using P5.js.
 
 Honestly the Oil Painting look is largely dependent on which brush texture you use. I've included several, but the results with many of the other brushes don't always look right. I personally render out several different copies of the same image with different brush sizes and then combine them in Affinity Photo (or Photoshop) for the best result. It tends to give me all the detail I want without making the pattern look too artificial. 
 
 This could be improved in many ways. but here's some of the use cases and examples with what I have now.
 
 Use Cases:
 - Making any photo look like an oil painting.

 - Taking a bad photoshop job and making it look like it is an original picture.

- The end results look great when printed on canvas!
